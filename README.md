# Bike-sharing-demand-prediction

Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast the bike rental count based on various features such as date, weather conditions, and time of the day. The project utilizes hour datasets." The "day" dataset contains daily aggregated bike rental information, while the "hour" dataset provides hourly details.
Dataset Description
Day Dataset

## The "day" dataset consists of the following columns:

    - instant: A unique identifier for each record
    - dteday: Date of the record
    - season: Season of the year (1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter)
    - yr: Year (0 = 2011, 1 = 2012)
    - mnth: Month (1 to 12)
    - holiday: Binary flag indicating if it is a holiday (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    - weekday: Day of the week (0 to 6, where 0 = Sunday)
    - workingday: Binary flag indicating if it is a working day (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    - weathersit: Weather situation (1 = clear, 2 = mist/cloudy, 3 = light rain/snow, 4 = heavy rain/snow)
    - temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius
    - atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
    - hum: Normalized humidity
    - windspeed: Normalized wind speed
    - casual: Count of casual bike rentals
    - registered: Count of registered bike rentals
    - cnt: Total count of bike rentals (casual + registered)

    - hr: Hour of the day (0 to 23)
    - holiday: Binary flag indicating if it is a holiday (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    - weekday: Day of the week (0 to 6, where 0 = Sunday)
    - workingday: Binary flag indicating if it is a working day (1 = yes, 0 = no)
    - weathersit: Weather situation (1 = clear, 2 = mist/cloudy, 3 = light rain/snow, 4 = heavy rain/snow)
    - temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius
    - atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius
    - hum: Normalized humidity
    - windspeed: Normalized wind speed
    - casual: Count of casual bike rentals
    - registered: Count of registered bike rentals
    - cnt: Total count of bike rentals (casual + registered)
    
To run the project locally, please ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

3. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
4. Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different models and parameters.

## Results

The results of the bike sharing demand prediction are evaluated based on various metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into the performance of the model and how well it predicts bike sharing demand.

## Model Building and Selection

To predict the bike rental count, several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated. The following algorithms were utilized:

    Linear Regression
    Random Forest
    Extra Trees Regressor
    LightGBM
    XGBoost

After training and evaluating these models, XGBoost was chosen as the final model due to its superior performance in terms of accuracy and predictive power.
Model Deployment

The selected XGBoost model was deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The deployment allows users to input the relevant features such as date, weather conditions, and time, and obtain the predicted bike rental count as the output.

The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model and obtaining real-time predictions.
Usage

To use the deployed model, follow these steps:

    1) Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt(make sure to remove commented e .).
    2) First train the model using command python src/pipeline/training_pipeline.py which creates model. 
    3) Then run the Streamlit application using the command streamlit run src/components/streamlit.py.
    4) Access the application in your web browser at the provided URL.
    5) Enter the required input features such as date, weather conditions, and time etc.
    6) Click the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted bike rental count.

Please note that the accuracy of the predictions may vary based on the input data and model performance.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models in predicting bike rental counts. By leveraging the power of XGBoost and utilizing various input features, the model achieves accurate predictions, allowing users to make informed decisions related to bike rental management.

The Streamlit deployment provides a convenient and interactive way to access the model's predictions, making it user-friendly and accessible to a wide range of users.
